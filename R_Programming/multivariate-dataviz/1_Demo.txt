# for Facetgrid # formula is Rows ~ Columns
# Which variables should be faceted on rows and which on columns
# DOT . tells that there should be no facetting on specified dimension
# So .~RAting means we want to facet by single variable Rating and we want it horizontally
# i.e. on Columns (Facetting on columns)  ROWS ~ COLUMNS

# Creating Vertical Plotts

# MAke it acc to columns but make it rows if its too wide.
# Facetwrap is one sided so we cant have anything on left side of ~ in WRAP
# in GGPLOT2 each category in categorical variable can be used to make a facet of plots.

# Creating a 2D facet chart horizontal 
# Here we re considering 2 Categorical variable, Awards and Rating
# Box Office tells the revenue in million dollars
