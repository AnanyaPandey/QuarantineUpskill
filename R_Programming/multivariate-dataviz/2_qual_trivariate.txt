2_qualitative Multivariate analysis
Whenever categorical variables are in picture we need to consider the frequency of categories. 
our surface is 2D hence we need some taabular technique to represent the three variables. 

3-way contingency table is one of those. 
We can create multiple tables based out of 3rd categorical variable and represent the remaining two variable in the form of table

Faceted frequency batchart -----
We can used Faceted frequency batchart for representing categorical variable. 
EAch facet will represent one category of a variable. and within each facet there will be frequency graph 


Faceted stacked frequency batchart ------
this is same barchart just stacked and same bar is different coloured representing category

Faceted frewuency barchart -------
we can have the barcharts stacked by the cateogory of one /. twi variable across rows and columns.

# Setting directory and data
setwd("/Users/ananyapa/Gdrive/LEARNING/R_Programming/multivariate-dataviz")
movies <- read.csv("m2/Movies.csv")

# if we are trying to visualize 3 categorical variable we have to take and represent the frequency in the table
# we need to create three way contingency table 

gettable <- function(distCategory){
  filter <- movies$Distribution == distCategory
  # 3rd variable is passed through the argument : distribution
  # first and 2nd variable are Movie Rating and Awards
  # Distribution of movie tells whether its domestic or international
  subset <- movies[filter,] # all those filtered movies that match
  table(x =subset$Awards, y = subset$Rating) # awards x axis, rating on y axis
}

# Displaying contingency tables 
gettable("Domestic")
gettable("International")

# Hotizontal facet 
par(mfrow = c(1,2)) # 1 row 2 column
barplot(height = gettable("Domestic"),
        beside = TRUE,
        ylim = c(0,600),
        main = "Domestic",
        xlab = "Movie Rating",
        ylab = "Count of Movies")

barplot(height = gettable("International"),

# Stacked ferquency plot

## Now create a function to create frequency table :

gettable2 <- function(awards,distribution){
  filter <- movies$Distribution == distribution & movies$Awards == awards
  # Both condition must satisfy
  subset <- movies[filter,]
  table(subset$Rating)
}

# awards have 2 categories
# Distribution has 2 categories 
# Sototal there will be 4 tables

# Frequency distribution of movie Rating according ot variables
gettable2("No Awards","Domestic")
gettable2("No Awards","International")
gettable2("Won Awards","Domestic")
gettable2("Won Awards","International")

par(mfrow = c(2,2))

makebarplot <- function(award,dist,name){
  barplot(height = gettable2(award, dist),
          ylim = c(0,600),
          main = name,
          ylab = "Count of Movies",
          xlab = "Movie Rating")
}

makebarplot("No Awards","Domestic","No Award Domestic")
makebarplot("Won Awards","Domestic","Won Award Domestic")
makebarplot("No Awards","International","No Award International")
makebarplot("Won Awards","International","No Award Internatioaal")

# EACH barplot represent single variable :
# we can introduce one more variable here and mention BESIDE argument 

# Resetting mfrow
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
