# Google Cloud Platform
## Introduction
#### By Brian Rice

Cloud is a home for application and Data. What is unique what is the pricing and the network of it. 

**Cloud Computing** 
A way of using IT through internet. Using cloud it can be used in an On demand basis, it has a broad netowrk access, It provides resource pooling. It has elastic scaling, and a measured service, so users pay as they go. 

Co - location got it here. Huge Data center management costs got us here. Also after virtualization it became to flexible. 
Virtualization, Serverless and Co location help us get here using cloud everywhere.Google few years before moved from virtualiozation to a container based model. 

GCP (Google Cloud Platform's ) Computing Architecture : IAAS and PAAS 
IAAS Computing Engine (PAy for allocatre)
PAAS : Libraries to the applications  (Pay for Use)

IAAS -> Hybrid -> PAAS -> Serverless logic -> Managed Services
(Managed Infra).       ->.         ->.        (Dynamic Infrastructure)

SAAS > gmail, docs, and other applications are softwares available online in SAAS format. 

#### Google network : 
Googles network consists of approx 40% of ineternet traffic across world. more rthan 90 Interconnect sources. Its target is to minimise the latency. 

#### GCP Regions and Zones : 
Zone is deployment area for GCP resources. That is not exactly physocally present at that zone. Indpeendent geographic areas ather there to provide better reach to the users across world. Zone is a single failure domain in that region. 
Resources can spread across zones. 

#### Environmental Responsibility :  
Google Cloud received ISO 14001 certified. Most efficient google is 100% Carbon neutral. 
Users who have environment sustainability is their goal can make use of GCP and meet their target of doing so. 

##### customer friendly pricing : 
Discounts and per second billing. Compute engine if uses the significant part of billing it automatically gives discount for every incremental minute user uses. 

#### Open APIs : 
Google gives flexibility to shift to another vendor using OPen APIs. most google platforms are compatible with open servers.

#### Why GCP 
It provides to choose from 100s of variety of products 
Compute Big data
Storage, Machine Learning, Big data etc and other platforms across world efficiently in a better billing model. 

#### Multi layered security Approach : 
Designed for security as pervasive. Keeping customers data safe is the first priority. 
Encryption
Self Data Center
Physical Chip
Cryptographic security. 
Secure boot stack. 
Front end Denial of service protection.
Auto monitor users with admin access. 

#### Budget and Billing
Four tools in which user can create the budget and alerts.  IT can be per billing account or per billing component. 
You can set an alert of budget 80% of the budget. Detailed Billing information is available for a detailed analysis.  
Reports to analyse expense. Over consumption of resources.
