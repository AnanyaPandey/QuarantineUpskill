4_Two Categorical Variable 
Qualitative Bivaraite Analysis 
========================================

Since there are two categorical variables we will need to create a freq table of these two categories
1. Joint Frequency
2. MArginal Frequency ( sum of all those categories is called marginal frequency)
3. RElative Frequency : the freq may not be sum it can be sum / total i.t. the value between 0 and 1 
# Basically percentage of total 

## Base Graphics for Bivariate Qualitative Visuzlization 

awards <- table(movies$award, movies$Cat1)
awards
 
print(awards)

# Bar Chart
barplot(height = awards, beside = TRUE,
        main = "Plotting Category and Awards",
        xlab = "Categories",
        yab = "Count of movies",
        legend = c("Award","No Award"),
        args.legend = list(x = "topright", title = "Awards")
        )

# Stacked Frequency Bar Chart

barplot(height = awards,
        main = "Count of movies winning awards ",
        xlab = "Categories",
        ylab = "Count of Movies",
        legend = c("Award","No Award"),
        args.legend = list(x = "topright", title = "Awards")
        )

# Creating the proportional bar chart (e.g. 100% Stacked)
# in order to create we need to create proportions 
# 2 indicate columns, 1 indicate Rows 
proportions = apply(awards,2, function(x) {x/sum(x)})

# These proportions are relative to the only onservatoins in awards and not all observations

barplot(height = proportions,
        main = "proportions, award wining acc to movie categories",
        ylab = "Proportions",
        xlab = "Movie Categories",
        legend = c("Award","No Award"),
        args.legend = list(x = "topright", title = "Awards", inset=c(-0.2,0))
        )

# Transposed our data 
awards <- table(movies$Cat1, movies$award)
colnames(awards) = c("No", "Yes")

# SPINE PLOT
spineplot(x = awards,
          main = "proportion of awards, by Movie Category",
          xlab = "Movie Categories",
          ylab = "Awards")
# Observations with higher number are bigger and others are small

# Mosaic Plot 
mosaicplot(x = awards,
          main = "proportion of awards, by Movie Category",
          xlab = "Movie Categories",
          ylab = "Awards")
