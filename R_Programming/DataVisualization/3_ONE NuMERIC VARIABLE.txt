ONE NuMERIC VARIABLE 
Quantitative Univariate Analysis 

Base
Lattice
ggplot2

1.DOT PLOT 
how data is distributed along the variable

movies$Runtime..Minutes.
names(movies)[names(movies)=="Runtime..Minutes."] <- "Runtime"
# REnaming the column for ease 
# Runtime is in minutes

each dot represents an observation (a movie), here all observaions overlap each other 
so we can se a convenient single line with higher to lower density

2. Jitter plot 
Adds the noise along the y axis so that observations do not overlap each other
Jitter is like a scatterplot but with single variable, 
Specially good for large number of discrete numeric values 

3. BOX PLOT 
box and whisker plot : same single numeric variable can be represented using a box
telling the quantiles, 1st quartile, median, 3rd and max number.
It considers 1.5 times lowere and upper of the extremes 
Good for telling spread, and outliers.


4. histogram
approzimation of distribution by showing data in bins. hieght represent number of obs.
histogram can be for categorical as well (with numeric it needs binning)
Histogram can easily tell the skewness of the variable. 

5. DENSITY plot
density represent shows shape of the distribution like histogram with inifite binning.
location, spread and shape of data. It is smooth representation as a function
a prob density function. Entire area inside curve = 1

Although we draw the plot like a 2 dimensions it is actually showing a univariate data
rep(0,1000) # gives 1000 zeros as a vector which exactly is y in our plot.

Adding Jitter to the above plot. Jitter is the noise.
