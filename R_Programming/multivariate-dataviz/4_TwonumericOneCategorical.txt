Two Numeric One Categorical Data Analysis 

1. ######## BASE GRAPHICS ###############

# 1 Qualittive and 1 quantitqative data
# best way is to compare the numeric values based on each category 
# Also time series analysis can be performed conditioned by categorical values 
# one row for each point in time 
# Shape coded colour coded scatterplot ; Facetted scatter plots 
# Multi series line chart : time series data ; Stacked area chart 
# Faceted Line chart : facets for categorical variable
