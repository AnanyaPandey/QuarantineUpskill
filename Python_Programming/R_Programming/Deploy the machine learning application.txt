# R markdown can be used to create documents 
# Webpages, R code and html Text outputs etc
# Interactive applications like Shiny
# can be deployed to R server 
# Can be deployed to cloud to create ML application. Rscript can be directly created application,


################# Shiny ################3
interactive data visualization framework by creators of RStudio
Shiny app
	UI
	Web server (take input from UI)
# Shiny apps are created in R only.


shiny UI Layout
ui <- fluidpage(
	titlepanel("Title Panel"),
	sidebarlayout(
		sidebarpanel("Sidebar Panel")
		mainpanel("Main Panel")))

# There are many layout functions. Above one has 3 components. ours is not a fixed layout, it is fluid layout.
# There are buttons, checbox, sliders inputs, radio buttons, file input many more

# input takes value from the input slider ceated earlier. and provides the output to the UI
