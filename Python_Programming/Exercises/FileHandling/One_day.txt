One day You'll meet a guy, and ultimately he's going to find out how you chew, how you sip, how you dance, how you sing, how you smell at every point in the day, how your face looks underneath makeup and without. How messy your hair is, how poorly you dress at home, How sweaty you can become during summar, How you love choclate, how you can be hyper at times, how particular you are for few things, how certain games and stupid shows make you really happy, How Cranky you can get when you're tired, how weak you feel when you're down, How you think you look bad in some photos, He is going to know everything about you. 

And you know what? he's still going to love you for everything.
