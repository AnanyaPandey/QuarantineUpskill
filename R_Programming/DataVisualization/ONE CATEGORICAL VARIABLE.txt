# 2 Visualizing ONE CATEGORICAL VARIABLE 
# Qualitative univariate analysis 

Bar chart
histogram 
pie chart 

###### Frequency Bar chart.
X Axis : variable (Categorical, multiple categories.)
Y Axis : Quantity 

Frequency of each category in the Categorical variable X, there can be more than 1 caetgories
# If there are more categories it makes sense to rotate the categories to Y axis.

###### Cleveland Dot Plot
very good for frequency chart with many number of categories. 
This plot has a very high data-to-ink ratio. with minimum ink (required to print that plot) we must be able to provide as much information as possible. 
Thus plot must be easier to read. 

##### Pie chart.
Part of the whole or proportion. NOT A great tool to mention many categories. 
When categories are less pie chart may be recommended. 

Questions to ask ?
  How many movies each category?
  which proportions of movies have won awards?
