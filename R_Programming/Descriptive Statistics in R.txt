How many cars of each transmission ?
What does fuel economy distribution look like ?


# Create a frequency table
table(cars$transmission)

table(carsdata$cyl)
 4  6  8 
 6  3 12 

> min(carsdata$mpg)
[1] 10.4

> max(carsdata$mpg)
[1] 33.9

> median(carsdata$mpg)
[1] 17.8

> quantile(carsdata$mpg)
  0%  25%  50%  75% 100% 
10.4 15.2 17.8 21.5 33.9 


# Get the correlation coefficient 
cor(carsdata$mpg,carsdata$mpg)
# relation between miles per gallon and cylinders in car. 


# summary(carsdata)
REturns the min max quantile etc dat afor all numerical columns. 
For categorical it returns the frequency
