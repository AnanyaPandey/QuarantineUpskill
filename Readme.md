## ANN_Learning
Artificial neural networks (ANN) or connectionist systems are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.[1] Such systems "learn" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with task-specific rules. For example, in image recognition, they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as "cat" or "no cat" and using the results to identify cats in other images. They do this without any prior knowledge of cats, for example, that they have fur, tails, whiskers and cat-like faces. Instead, they automatically generate identifying characteristics from the examples that they process.

An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a signal to other neurons. An artificial neuron that receives a signal then processes it and can signal neurons connected to it.

## AWS_ML
Build, train, and deploy machine learning models fast

Amazon SageMaker enables developers and data scientists to quickly and easily build, train, and deploy machine learning models at any scale. It removes the complexity that gets in the way of successfully implementing machine learning across use cases and industries—from running models for real-time fraud detection, to virtually analyzing biological impacts of potential drugs, to predicting stolen-base success in baseball.

Amazon SageMaker Studio: Experience the first fully integrated development environment (IDE) for machine learning with Amazon SageMaker Studio, where you can perform all ML development steps. You can quickly upload data, create and share new notebooks, train and tune ML models, move back and forth between steps to adjust experiments, debug and compare results, and deploy and monitor ML models all in a single visual interface, making you much more productive.

Amazon SageMaker Autopilot: Automatically build, train, and tune models with full visibility and control, using Amazon SageMaker Autopilot. It is the industry’s first automated machine learning capability that gives you complete control and visibility into how your models were created and what logic was used in creating these models.

## GoogleCloudComputing
Google Cloud Platform (GCP), offered by Google, is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search, Gmail and YouTube. Alongside a set of management tools, it provides a series of modular cloud services including computing, data storage, data analytics and machine learning. Registration requires a credit card or bank account details.

Google Cloud Platform provides infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and serverless computing environments.

## Python_Programming
The code readability of Python sets it apart as one of the most widely used programming languages in the industry. With Pluralsight, you’ll learn how to build, deploy and scale programs in Python, with training that covers everything from the fundamentals to deep-dive development.
