2 Categorical and 1 Numeric Variable Eploratory Analysis

Basically there is an aggregate of numeric variable which is at the intersection of both the categorical variable.
we typically use the table in the 2 dimensional format. 
The aggregagte measure could be max min sum mean etc. 

The table could be row-wise, column wise of tabular # for ggplot we do not need to create a seprate table. 


# aggregate of two qualitative and 1 Quantitative variable 
# numeic variable :: aggregate : sum / count / min / max etc.
# it could be helpful to create table to represent the data in tabular way
